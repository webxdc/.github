**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

Here you can find several webxdc projects, interactive content for the [Delta 
Chat messenger](https://delta.chat). If you want to develop your own webxdc,
best get started with our
[documentation!](https://deltachat.github.io/webxdc_docs/)!

## Contributing

If you want your webxdc to be listed here, you can write us at
[delta@merlinux.eu](mailto:delta@merlinux.eu).

What your repository needs to be included here:

- your webxdc needs to be compatible with Delta Chat 1.30
- a README.md file which explains your webxdc and includes at least one screenshot
