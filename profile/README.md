## Welcome to webxdc!

Here you can find several webxdc projects, interactive content for the [Delta 
Chat messenger](https://delta.chat). If you want to develop your own webxdc,
best get started with our
[documentation](https://deltachat.github.io/webxdc_docs/)!

To try out webxdc, just send an .xdc file as an attachment in Delta Chat
(minimum version 1.30) and press "Start".

## Contributing

If you want your webxdc to be listed here, you can write us at
[delta@merlinux.eu](mailto:delta@merlinux.eu).

What your repository needs to be included here:

- your webxdc needs to be compatible with Delta Chat 1.30
- a README.md file which explains your webxdc and includes at least one screenshot
